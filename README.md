# Test Suite Optimization Using Metaheuristic Algorithms

## Introduction
This repository provides an implementation of research focusing on software test suite optimization using Genetic Algorithms (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and a Hybrid Genetic-PSO algorithm. These methods are designed to optimize large and complex test suites, making the regression testing process more efficient.

## Motivation
Software testing, especially regression testing, can be a resource-intensive process. As the number of test cases in a test suite grows, executing all of them becomes impractical, leading to increased costs and delayed software releases. This research explores nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms to optimize test suites, ensuring effectiveness and efficiency.

## Problem Domain
- **Test Suite Optimization**: Testing accounts for over 52% of software development costs, and traditional optimization methods struggle with large and dynamic test suites.
- **Metaheuristic Algorithms**: Conventional methods often fall short for regression testing, which is complex and NP-hard. Metaheuristic algorithms offer a more adaptable and efficient solution, though they also face challenges like high data requirements and inconsistent accuracy.

## Key Concepts
- **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**: Inspired by natural selection, GA provides robust solutions for optimizing complex problems by simulating the process of natural evolution.
- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**: Based on the social behavior of birds or fish, PSO is effective at quickly finding optimal solutions in a continuous search space.
- **Hybrid GA-PSO**: A novel combination of GA and PSO that aims to leverage the strengths of both algorithms for more balanced performance.

## Research Goals
- To address inefficiencies in current test suite optimization methods.
- To design and evaluate a Hybrid GA-PSO algorithm that performs well in terms of speed, accuracy, and resource usage.
